This package implements an unique method for utilizing frequent item-set data mining techniques in exhaustive
combinatorics to find conserved patterns in the different global causes of mortality. A modified version of the apriori
algorithm is implemented to find the common causes mortality across the globe in a set of 35 icd codes. The theory being
that once all of the conserved possible combinations leading to morbidity across the globe are determined, one may
tentatively identify whether the underlying etiologies of these diseases or groups of diseases are genetic or
environmental.
